## ðŸš€ Features

- Cleaned and processed raw post data
- Calculated engagement and virality metrics
- Built an interactive web dashboard using Streamlit
- Visualized metrics by platform, post type, and over time

## ðŸ”„ Data Processing Summary

The raw data required significant preprocessing, all of which was done using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook (`Data Processing.ipynb`):

- The **`post_date`** column had inconsistent formats (e.g., `"2025-06-01"` and `"05-May-2025"`). All dates were parsed and converted to a standard datetime format.
- The **`likes`** column contained commas (e.g., `"1,200"`) which prevented numeric operations. These commas were removed and the values were converted to floats.
- Missing values in `likes` and `shares` were filled using the **median** of their respective columns to avoid distortion from outliers.
- Derived new KPI columns:
  - **`total_engagement`** = likes + comments + shares
  - **`engagement_rate`** = (total_engagement / reach) Ã— 100
  - **`virality_rate`** = (shares / impressions) Ã— 100
- Exported the final cleaned dataset as `cleaned_data.xlsx` for use in the Streamlit app.

## ðŸ“Š Key Performance Indicators

- **Engagement Rate (%)** = `(likes + comments + shares) / reach Ã— 100`
- **Virality Rate (%)** = `shares / impressions Ã— 100`
- **Follower Growth Over Time**
- **Average Reach by Platform**
- **Engagement Rate by Post Type**
